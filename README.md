<h1>TSA Randomizer</h1>

It has come to light in the past few days that TSA has
paid $1.4 million a Randomizer app to assist with Pre-Check. This
app chooses whether a passenger will go through the left or right
Pre-Check lane. While the cost for the app was *only* $336,000
according to[this](https://kev.inburke.com/tsa/contract.pdf)
informationobtained through the Freedom of Information Act, there were
[8 more payments](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/AdvancedSearch.aspx?k=HSTS0313JCIO494)
pertaining to the same project, adding up to $1.4 million. It's also
interesting to note that these payments are spread over 11 months.
